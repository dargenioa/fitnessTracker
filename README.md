Any burgers that are waiting to be devoured or deleted will be rendered to the page.  To add a new burger, simply type in the burger name in the input field and hit submit.  Once submitted, the burger will be added to the devoured list.  To devour a burger, simply click on the devour button next to the burger to move it to the waiting to be deleted section.  When the user is ready, they will be able to delete the burger.  The burgers are tracked by an incremental ID in MySQL.

  ## Tests

  The burgers are tracked by the incremented ID.  This iD is used to delete a burger entirely or to update the status of the burger from devour to delete.  This application has a server, connection to MySQL, an ORM file, a model, a controller and a client side JavaScript file to create ajax calls for the GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests.  The results are logged to the console and the page will automatically reload using ```location.reload();```.
